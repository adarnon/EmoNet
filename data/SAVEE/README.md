# Surrey Audio-Visual Expressed Emotion (SAVEE) Database

## Audio-only Sentiment Data
The SAVEE database was recorded from four native English male speakers (identified as DC, JE, JK, KL), postgraduate students and researchers at the University of Surrey aged from 27 to 31 years. Emotion has been described psychologically in discrete categories: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise. 

### File naming convention
Each of the 480 files has a unique filename. The filename consists of a 3-part alpha-numerical identifier (e.g., DC_a01.wav). These identifiers define the following characteristics:

### Filename identifiers
